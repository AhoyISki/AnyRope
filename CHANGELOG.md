# 0.7.0 (2018-07-05)

Peformance improvements:

* `RopeSlice`s have been given a major speed boost for small slices: for contiguous slices of text in memory, they will simply point at the text without any tree structure.  This makes it feasible to use `RopeSlice`s to yield e.g. graphemes or words, even in tight inner loops, while maintaining performance.

New features:

* You can now fetch contiguous chunks of text directly from `Rope`s and `RopeSlice`s, via byte or char index.  The chunk containing the given byte or char will be returned along with offset information.

* Added more index conversion methods.  For both `Rope`s and `RopeSlice`s, you can now convert between any of: byte, char, and line indices.

* Added a method to directly create `RopeSlice`s from string slices.  This isn't terribly useful when using Ropey's standard API's, but it allows for much more efficient implementations of things like custom iterators.

* Added a method to directly access a `RopeSlice`s text as a contiguous string slice when possible.  This is useful for client code to be able to make a fast-path branch for small slices that happen to be contiguous.  Like the above item, this can result in significant performance gains for certain use-cases.

API breaking-changes:

* All grapheme related APIs have been removed.  However, new APIs have been added that allow the efficient implementation of those same APIs on top of Ropey.  See the grapheme examples in the `examples` directory of the repo for working implementations.


# 0.6.3 (2018-01-28)

Features:

* Added a new `Rope::insert_char()` convenience method for inserting a single Unicode scalar value.

Documentation:

* Updated the Chunks iterator docs to accurately reflect the new segmentation API in 0.6.x.


# 0.6.2 (2018-01-11)

Fixes:

* 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 had an API regression where you now had to specify the
  segmenter in the type parameters of RopeSlice and the various iterators.


# 0.6.1 (2018-01-11)

No functional changes.  Just updated the readme to render properly on crates.io.


# 0.6.0 (2018-01-11)

New features:

* Grapheme segmentation can now be customized if needed.

API changes:

* `Rope::remove()`, `Rope::slice()`, and `RopeSlice::slice()` now take range syntax to specify
  their ranges.


# 0.5.6 (2018-01-05)

Documenation:

* Added a design overview document to the repo, explaining Ropey's design.  Mainly targeted at potential contributors.
* Added a more integrated example of usage to the front page of the library docs.

Features:

* Fleshed out the `PartialEq` impls.  `Rope` and `RopeSlice` can now be compared for equality with not just `&str`, but also `String` and `Cow<str>`.

Performance:

* `Rope::char()`, which fetches a single Unicode scalar value as a `char`, is now several times faster.

Misc:

* This changelog had the wrong year on some of its dates.  Heh...


# 0.5.5 (2017-12-30)

Bug fixes:

* Comparing two empty ropes for equality would panic.

New features:

* Added Rope::capacity() and Rope::shrink_to_fit() methods.  Although these are probably of limited use, they may be useful in especially memory-constrained environments.


# 0.5.4 (2017-12-30)

Bug fixes:

* Rope::remove() didn't always merge graphemes between chunks properly.

Performance and memory:

* Inserting large texts into a rope now degrades in performance more gracefully as the insertion text becomes larger, rather than hitting a sudden performance cliff.
* `Rope::remove()` got a nice speed boost.
* Memory overhead has been reduced across the board.  Freshly loaded files now only have ~17% overhead, and the worst-case (built up from lots of small random-location inserts) is now ~60% overhead.

Misc:

* 100% unit test coverage of public APIs.
* Added randomized testing via [QuickCheck](https://crates.io/crates/quickcheck).
* Added benchmarks to the library.


# 0.5.3 (2017-12-28)

Performance and memory:

* Massive speed boost for small insertions: between %40 - %50 faster.
* `Rope::from_str()` now only uses stack memory for strings smaller than ~3MB. (Aside from the resulting Rope itself, of course.)

Misc:

* Better unit test coverage of public APIs.  Still not 100%, but getting there!


# 0.5.2 (2017-12-25)

Bug fixes:

* There were ocassionally unnecessary heap allocations that took up a small amount of extra space in the rope.

Misc:

* Memory overhead has been significantly reduced for ropes built up by many small coherent insertions.


# 0.5.1 (2017-12-24)

Bug fixes:

* Calling `Rope::line_to_char()` with a line index one-past-the-end would panic.  This wasn't consistent with other indexing, and has been fixed and now returns the one-past-the-end char index.
* Had accidentally left some asserts in the `Rope::remove()` code that were put in during debugging.  They were causing significant slow downs for removes.

Misc:

* Added a changelog file.
